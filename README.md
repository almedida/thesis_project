<h2>Estimating the Number of Differentially Expressed Genes in Two Dependent Experiments or Analyses</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Proposed a method for estimating the number of differentially expressed genes in two dependent experiments or analyses using Truncated Bivariate Normal distribution</li>
<li>Used both moderated t-test and student t-test to test for genes that are differentially expressed in two dependnt experiments or analyses</li>
<li>Used lambda estimator (by Storey and Tibshirani) and Histogram-based method (by Liang and Nettleton) 
  to determine m pairs of p-values in the upper-right quadrant of the histogram of p-values</li>
  <li>Performed simulation studies and compared the performance of the proposed method to known methods</li>
  </ul>
